# How Do You 'Value' a Cryptocurrency?

First things first, I think cryptocurrencies are going to become increasingly used and relied upon to power global payment systems. Right now these systems are dominated by a few very large institutions, and "democratising" that is always a good thing. The specifics of crypto may change, the regulation and the way people use them, but the general trend will continue. For an increasingly digital-first world, we need a digital-first medium-of-exchange.

However, the issue I will be exploring with this document is how to 'value' a given cryptocurrency. I think there is a fundamental issue when people use things like Gold or Dollars to explain the value of crypto, because it isn't very analogous. Crypto, like Gold, Dollars, etc., will fluctuate based on supply and demand, but that doesn't mean they're comparable. The way crypto derives value is more similar to how other software system do so: Whether that's an operating system, an algorithm for natural language processing, or the very site you're viewing this document on.

### Properties That Give Crypto/Technology Value

1. **Function**:
    * Does the technology serve a purpose/solve a problem?
    * How effectively does it solve the problem? Reliability? Maintainability?
    * How valuable is the solution to said problem?
        * Ex. Let's say Google wants to increase their ad-driven article click-though rate by 30%, which would generate an additional ~$750 million in profit per year. I develop a solution by building an AI to read articles, and formulate summaries that can better entice readers, thus raising the click rate. The average break-even point for an investment is typically ~3 years, so that might be a $2.5 billion solution.
    * Is it unique? Are there any comparable alternatives to your system?

2. **Efficiency, Scalability, and Economics:**
    * Can the system be operated on an cost-effective basis?
        * Can the network and the miners negotiate a 'fair price' for work? E.g. You need to issue enough tokens to maintain/compensate the network of miners. Additionally, you don't want to issue too many tokens, because it will put downward pressure on the price of tokens, thus undermining the aforementioned 'fair price'. It's a balancing game: issuing enough tokens to compensate miners for the hardware, electricity, and opportunity costs of operating a server, while not issuing too many new tokens that it debases the value (inflation).
        * **Note**: I am not a fan of Bitcoin's finite token supply. If the bitcoin network is going to be able to sustain itself over time, it needs to scale its 'money' supply. The core of the issue is the **mucho no bueno** relationship between the logarithmic token issuance and the exponential miner cost curves. Bitcoin is not capable of being a long-term medium of exchange because eventually the distance between these curves will become so great, it will become entirely uneconomical to operate the Bitcoin network.
        * **Another Note**: While it's way better than the fixed issuance model, you can still 'break' the continuous issuance model. If there are no 'new assets' being spent into a network, but transactions are still taking place (shuffling around the same assets within the network), the 'money supply' would increase without the assets within the network going up, which would be marginally inflationary. However, this would probably be an unlikely issue, especially amongst the larger coins - as long as the growth rate of new assets coming into the network meets or outpaces token creation, the 'price' of those tokens wont decrease. Additionally, Ethereum is planing on changing from 'Proof of Work', to 'Proof from Stake', which would reduce energy and hardware needs from miners. This would enable the Ethereum network to issue fewer ETH per transaction to miners, meaning the 'transaction inflation' would be less pronounced. This is why efficiency is so important imo. Energy, CPU cycles, etc are all valuable resources.
    * Can it handle a large number of actions? In the case of crypto, it needs to be able to process millions of transactions per hour (and be able to settle such transactions in the normal course of business)

3. **Community**
    * [Developer network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhh_GeBPOhs)
        * This is a special one because it has down-stream impacts on all 3 categories. Developers are one of the most important components in anything tech. They develop the capabilities, determine the efficiency, build out integrations, etc. To ensure the long-term health of a technology, there needs to be plenty of involvement from talented software engineers.
    * Marketing/Reputation amongst consumers
        * VHS vs Betamax is a great example of this. This is also one of the major advantages that bitcoin has at the moment.
    * Availability (PC, Mac, Mobile, etc)
    * User base
        * In order to hold an asset, you need to be confident that you can sell it to someone. The more users, the bigger the buyer and seller base, the more secure people feel about an asset.

### Conclusion

#### To summarise, if I were to buy a cryptocurrency, I would look at the following:
1. Is it efficient? E.g. Energy usage, time to settle transactions, bandwidth. If it's going to be a medium-of-exchange, it needs to be able to quickly handle large numbers of transactions, and do so without being the #1 consumer of energy in the world.
2. What is its usage like? Do lots of people/organisations use it? Does it have a solid development team? If you buy a crypto assets, you need to have confidence that you'll have someone to sell it to. Having a vibrant market of buyers, and sellers is a self-reinforcing trend. Additionally, if you're going to hold it over the long term, you need to know the long-term health of the platform is being looked after. So much of the value of crypto networks are its tech, and in order to preserve that value, it needs to be constantly enhanced and overhauled.

#### Crypto I like at the moment

I don't own any crypto at the moment. I own Gold, Silver and equities, but at some point I'll likely get into crypto. Here's what I'd consider if I were to buy today:

1. Ethereum
    * Pros: It has a large network of developers, users, and a wide range of use cases. Tech is solid.
    * Cons: Energy usage. Ethereum uses PoW, which is very expense to operate. They plan to replace that with PoS this/next year, which would reduce the energy usage. We'll see if/when that happens (and by how much energy needs go down), but if energy savings are as dramatic as speculated, it would make it a lot more attractive to me.

2. XRP
    * Pros: Fast, practical, energy efficient. Has partnerships with big companies to solve international payment issues. Looks to have a very solid developer platform.
    * Cons: I'm skeptical of the 'value' of the token. From what I gather, the ripple network is just a way to send money, not so much a token asset - I'm dubious at how much the XRP token could be worth. Could be lack of research on my part though.

Keep in mind, these are only those I have heard/read about. I'm sure there are other options that satisfy my criteria, in which case, refer to the above.
