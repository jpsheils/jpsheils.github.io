# Re-engineering, and Reclaiming our Financial Destiny
### Exploring the problems with, and potential solutions to the current economic model.

There many problems with the current state of our economic and financial model. This is not just true in Ireland, but an increasing proportion of the world. The main issue? Debt. The amount of debt growth (in all countries, sectors, etc) since the second world war (and particularly in the post-Soviet world order) has been remarkable. In my opinion, this debt has become untenable, but instead of addressing the problems in the system, and 'biting the bullet', countries and central banks have merely shifted the burden around to keep the system functioning (with QE, government debt expansion, outsourcing, etc). This works for a while, but like all bandages, it can only work for so long. The most dangerous consequence of this 'spreading around of the burden' is that everything is infected. The longer the system exists, the more entrenched it becomes, the more painful a 'solution' becomes - so for policy makers, it must be sustained at all costs. 

This document is meant to outline (to the best of my current understanding) the problems with the current model, its down-stream implications, and my solutions to said problems.
